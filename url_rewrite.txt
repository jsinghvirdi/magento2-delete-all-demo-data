To remove all URL rewrites related to the products, you can use that script SQL below.

DELETE FROM url_rewrite WHERE entity_type='product';


If you want just to remove the URL rewrites that were automatically generated, you can use this one.

DELETE FROM url_rewrite WHERE entity_type='product' AND is_autogenerated='1';
